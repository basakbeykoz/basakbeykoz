## Basic description of the service performed by Basak Beykoz

Basak Beykoz offers a service that is meant to connects her clients
with their own true nature. It's all about her clients realizing their own potential and capabilities, and using these to either overcome their challenges and/or leap towards things that they set as personal goals.

The nature of the life coaching service puts the client at the driver seat while Basak Beykoz joins the client as the co-pilot. Basak's work can be better described as being a mirror that only reflects things about the client that would help them to grow or reach their goals. She does misrepresent her client's nature to themselves, but rather helps  them to notice dysfunctional and/or detrimental aspects of their  thinking, and nudges them to rethink their past traumas and long-set and forgotten opinions on ideas that may require some revision by the client.

## Unique Qualities of Basak Beykoz

Basak Beykoz has worked in corporate environments throughout her adult
life, entering various fields such as news media publishing, defense industry, pharmaceutical industry and others. She is by nature an experience driven person who is no stranger to the finer things and places in life. And having also faced substantial hardships, both in her professional and personal life, Basak has no issues relating to the emotional states, ambitions, and reservations of her clients.

She has received her coaching training from acclaimed institutions and will likely continue her streak of high level success in her life coaching career. She also has a very mature and charming way of  connecting with her clients. This helps her to gain trust and create traction swiftly, allowing their clients to focus on their journey rather than worrying about conveying themselves or assessing the trustworthiness of their coach.

Compared to the keywords that are routinely used in coaching sector, Basak's descriptions of her character aspirations, the concepts that she focuses on as a coach and the character aspirations she employs are much more humane, inner peace oriented rather than being focused on external goals or interpersonal relationships.

The sector in general is more focused on professional life, building leadership skills or being able to handle the stress of the workplace or certain personal or professional investments that people are making or working towards. *Basak Beykoz is in such a position that, she understand these endeavors and has successfully executed these herself throughout her professional life. But on top of these, she developed a strong emphasis on human values and self care. This seems to be a tone that is lacking in the online content of the competitors and can be one area that can be used as a distinguishing factor.*

Her concept in her online media could subtly argue that: You are having problems in your life, maybe in your professional life, so you are looking for guidance to help you see through this period. And everyone you come across has this *professional* attitude that *already suffocated you* and is the reason you need the release and guidance in the first place. As a response, we offer a service that is more emotionally in touch with your feelings and who you feel like inside while having the entire repertoire of tricks and understanding of what you need to do to get through in your professional environment and/or modern life issues.

This requires her to diverge from her competitors that usually *talk at* their clients with their content. The messages are usually very sterile and aimed at communicating the training, skills and past experience of the coach or the institution. While these are definitely required in Basak Beykoz's case as well, her true qualities and her message has to start with an emotional hook and end with an emotional call to action that speaks to the audience at deeper than sterile level. But the messages still need to contain enough hints to communicate that she knows what she is doing and/or link to resources that show that she is on top of her game.

## the Basak Beykoz brand

The main difference of Basak Beykoz brand is the emphasis on human values. The brand can make the distinction that its tone is not sterile, that the client being human matters. It's not about getting ahead in professional life but more about finding your own colors, your own voice and inner peace, which then makes the world, professional life and aspirations more accessible to you.

As the service is highly dependent on the type of personality traits that the client has, it may be more beneficial to design approaches for every type that is more likely to look for the service that the brand provides.

For people who score high on conscientiousness, the aspect of building structure in their client's conduct and thinking could be the most effective strategy. People who are low on conscientiousness and feel the need to get better in this aspect would also resonate with this message, if they are weary of building structures, then they may be captured by another personality trait listed below.

People who are high on openness can be affected the messages of experiencing their life in a new way and opening themselves for seeing their own colors and true self. They are more likely to respond to messages that involve creation, thrill, noticing new things in their familiarity environment end learning to enjoy subtle things. People score low on openness may respond to messages on ethics and "what's right".

For people who seek coaching for reasons related to high neuroticism, the message that will resonate with them can be that they can find peace, their true self and experience life in a different way that is more favorable for their goals and inner peace. 

On extraversion front, people who score highly on these would, unless they are also defined by any of the traits that are mentioned above, may likely be interested in leadership, and more traditional coaching services, for this group, Basak Beykoz can communicate her skill set and past professional experience. 

Introverted people who are having trouble in their lives due to demands from them that require extraversion, may be captured by the messages that capture the high neuroticism group.

Introverted people who are happy with their nature but still want to get coaching can be captured by some other personality trait that they exhibit.

People who score high on agreeableness and aren't happy about this can be influenced by the messages of leadership, taking initiative, independence. People who are agreeable and enjoy this about themselves may be influenced by the same messages but would probably respond better to messages of learning how to use these skills more effectively. People who score low on agreeableness are more likely to oppose to any idea that they encounter during coaching and can be seen similar to people who score low on openness, they will have to be approached on some other personality trait they have.
